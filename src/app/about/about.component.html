      <h1>About the Institute
      </h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">TECHVERSITY, nestled in the scenes of Karaikal, a coastal enclave in the basin of river Kaveri is one among the ten new TECHVERSITYs in the Union Territory of Puducherry. Notwithstanding the tender age, TECHVERSITY is committed to produce effective and responsible technocrats who have the ability to serve the nation on its journey to growth and prosperity. In this process, students have been admitted from the academic year 2010-11 onwards through JEE Mains with 50% of seats reserved for the candidates having residence/native at Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe, Yanam and the remaining 50% seats are filled on all India basis. The institute provides keen guidance in terms of experienced and expert faculties as well as facilities to sculpt the bright minds into professionally balanced individuals, capable enough to take up challenges of nature, of society and of the marketplace. Presently, 61 faculty members along with 36 non-teaching staff are employed for an overall strength of 1250 students. Students are exposed to the most modern and up-to-date curriculum and contemporary developments in various disciplines of engineering. In addition to scientific and engineering skills, the institute provides scope to our upcoming graduates to get exposure to team work on experimental projects, presentations and communication skills and active participations in all extracurricular activities. Since necessity is the mother of inventions, our students have participated in every corner of need and took the chaos of early years as an opportunity to grow with self determination and innovation. To mention, the institute website and many laboratory experiments were designed and fabricated by them. The institution is at a constant attempt of making endeavours to scale new heights by developing a synergy between studies, research, and consulting/training activities</h5>
